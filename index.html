        Cities are not people. But, like people, cities have their own personalities: in some cases one city has many different personalities -- there are a dozen Londons, a crowd of different New Yorks.
            <p>A city is a collection of lives and buildings, and it has identity and personality. Cities exist in location, and in time.</p>

            <h3>Vacant Lots Project - Week 6</h3>
            <h4>April 9,2016</h4>
            <p>April weather has not been accommodating for this outdoor project. Temperatures have fallen into the forties and unpredictable rains make it an impossible task to gauge a good window of time to walk. Add on the mound of catch-up work post-Cuba and Spring Break, I've fallen behind on walking through Brownsville and updating the computer database and map. Fellows with FCNY will give final presentations and reports of their projects on May 6th, so I will have to adjust my timeline to make that date:
            <ul>
                <li>April 11-15: Complete walkthrough of: 
                    <ol><li>E 98 Street, Dumont Ave, Rockaway Ave, and East New York Ave</li>
                <li>Rockaway Ave, Dumont Ave, Van Sinderen Ave, and Linden Ave</li></ol>
                </li>
                <li>April 14: Report to CB 16 District Manager</li>
                <li>April 18-22: Revise report and map</li>
                <li>April 25-29: Provide final report to CB 16</li>
                <li>May 6: Fellows presentation and final reports</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Oh yes, and all this while trying to finish up my thesis, studio project, internship at DOT, and applying for internships/jobs!</p>

        <p>Our class went on a historic trip to Cuba. It wasn't so much historic on our part as it was the exact week that President Obama became the first US president in more than half a century to set foot in Havana and mend ties with the nation. Obama's trip pretty much forced our classes to change our entire itineraries, but really, everything for Mr. Pres. </p>
        <p>This time, we stayed in Cojimar, the outskirts of Havana, on the eastern side of the Bay. It's considered to be a more "local" area and gave us easy access to some of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen. It was an educational trip, of course. Sometimes the best way to learn is to visit the place itself and absorb by experience.</p>

        </div>
            
        <p>I returned to New York this time with a tinge of sadness and a multitude reflections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cuba's people continue to welcome us with warmth and kindess. I saw this even more while staying in Cojimar. It is the lifestyle of people who are not yet fazed by the lures of consumption. Then again, it could also be the influence of being and island country. But there is a naitivity and innocence in their daily lives that I hope does not change.</li>
                <li>I worry about the foreseeable changes. With the warming of relations between the US, capitalist ventures will be making way to Cuba. Is Cuba ready for this change? The quiet and local beaches that we visited will likely turn into huge resorts overrun with tourists and polluting the natural environment. This mentality may be perceived as an underestimation of the capacity of Cuban society--maybe adapting to changes will occur without struggle or negative impact. However, judging from what has happened in the United States with these businesses, I remain skeptical.</li>          
                <li>Can Cuba build its local economy without dependence on the tourism industry? How can Cubans be empowered as entrepreneurs in the face of this change?</li>
                <li>We arrived in Cuba on our first trip with very limited knowledge of the government and communities' existing efforts. However much background information we tried to read beforehand could not provide us with the full scope of what was in the works. No matter how much a government may seem in control, local residents and community members add another layer of work and complexity. Some of the things I especially enjoyed seeing and learning about this time were:
                    <ul>
                    <li>a "taller" (to be read in Spanish), which is part of a larger network of "talleres." Community leaders and volunteers lead enriching programs for residents, including music, computer classes, and art.</li>
                    <li>a scale map of a part of Havana City. Havana is about 700something square kilometers, and the map, which currently fills a large room, is of only about one-seventh of the city. This took four to five years to complete and is so sophisticated and useful in its organization that I was blown away.</li>
                    <li>community gardens in people's backyards! These consisted of dry toilets and an abundance of herb/spice gardens. These efforts are certainly worth bringing back and sharing with the US.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Vacant Lots Project - Week 4</h3>
            <h4>March 1, 2016</h4>

            <p>Ground coverage of Community District 16 remains on schedule. I've been diligent about completing my weekly walk-throughs, despite making constant adjustments around my work, school, and club schedule. Last week, I spent Presidents' Day walking through Ocean Hill as it started to snow. Coordinating a meet-up time with the District Manager, however, has been unsuccessful. Nevertheless, four weeks remain to complete the ground survey.</p>
            <p>Some things are clearer week by week, as much as other things become more confusing. With the help of my classmate and fellow FCNY Community Planning Fellow, I've sorted out multiple ways of identifying vacant lots and buildings. This methodology is much clearer than what I had originally had set on the first week. My first week's list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vacant Lot</li>
                <li>Not Vacant</li>
                <li>For Sale</li>
                <li>Vacant Storefront</li>
                <li>Parking</li>
                <li>Community Garden</li>
                <li>?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>has become:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vacant Lot</li>
                <li>Not Vacant</li>
                <li>For Sale</li>
                <li>Roll-down gate/Uncertain</li>
                <li>New Unoccupied Building/Under Construction</li>
                <li>Community Garden</li>
                <li>Open Space</li>
                <li>?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But then I find myself making additional notes to certain markers. For example, a "Not Vacant" might have a "Residential Development" tacked on. Or a "Vacant Lot" might have an additional "Used for Parking" description. But then I start to wonder: if people have turned the space into a working parking lot, is it still considered vacant? </p>
            <p>Aside from looking for vacant lots and buildings all day, I've had the opportunity to really explore Ocean Hill and Brownsville. I'm going to know the district pretty well by the end of this semester. Pitkin Avenue's sidestreets are lined with murals completed through a partnership between Groundswell and at-risk youth. The murals highlight the Brownsville community.</p>
